<p><strong>Salvatore M. Anzalone</strong> – <em>Université Paris 8, France</em> – Salvatore Maria Anzalone is Maître de Conférences at Université Paris 8 and member of the Artificial and Human Cognitions Laboratory (2016), leading the Cognition and Social Interactions group (2020). He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Palermo (2010). He collaborates since then with several institutions in Italy (University of Padua), Japan (Osaka University) and France (Sorbonne Université and  Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital). His research interests focus on Social Robotics, spanning from the analysis of interpersonal dynamics to the development of socio-cognitive behaviors, with the goal of  allowing robots to express high degrees of social intelligence. He extensively worked on such topics in the specific context of socially assistive robotics for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. He was awarded as JSPS Research Fellow from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (2011-2012) and recipient of a grant from the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (2013). He participated in several national and European projects such as the FP7 Michelangelo. He is currently coordinator of the French-Swiss bilateral project ANR-FNS iReCheck, co-coordinator of the French national project “Scène and Robotique” and, since 2017, part of the steering committee of the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics group of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence. Since 2021, he is managing editor of the Springer’s International Journal of Social Robotics.</p>

<p><strong>Gloria Beraldo</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp; <em>National Research Council, CNR, Rome, Italy</em> – Gloria Beraldo received the M.Sc. degree cum laude in computer science engineering and the Ph.D. in information engineering with Doctor Europaeus mention from the University of Padova, Padua, Italy, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. In 2019, she was a visiting researcher at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland. She is currently a postdoc at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, Italian National Research Council. She is involved in the SI-ROBOTICS (Social robotics for active and healthy ageing)&nbsp;project that aims to design and develop new and easily adaptable ICT assistive robotic technologies to help the elderly in daily activities and to assess the progress of their physical and cognitive decline. She is also a contract professor at the Department of Information Engineering and Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova.  Her research is focused on designing novel semi-autonomous human-robot interactions with particular attention to the case of brain–machine interface driven robotics devices. She is investigating how to decode high-level user’s intention, for instance from his/her brain activity, through supervised machine learning techniques and fuse it with the perception of the robot to achieve advanced forms of human-robot interaction. Her research interests include human–robot interaction, shared control and shared autonomy for mobile robots, neurorobotics, socially assistive robotics, intelligent systems.</p>
