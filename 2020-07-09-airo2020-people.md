<p><strong>Salvatore M. Anzalone</strong> – <em>Université Paris 8, France</em> –  Salvatore Anzalone is Maître de Conferences at Paris 8 University in Saint Denis, France and member of the Equipe Technologies, Handicaps, Interfaces, Multimodalité (THIM) at the Human and Artificial Cognition Laboratory (CHArt, EA4004). His fields of expertise cover social robotics, multimodal interaction, social signal processing, social learning and robotics for socio-cognitive and neurodevelopmental diseases. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Palermo (2010). He collaborates since then with the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory directed by Prof. H. Ishiguro, joining the Osaka University several times thanks to grants he received during the years, in particular: in 2009, during his Ph.D.; in 2011-2012, thanks to the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS Short Term Fellowship); in 2013, thanks to the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). He was Post-Doc research fellow at&nbsp; the Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory, at the University of Padova (2010-2011), and at Sorbonne University (formerly Pierre and Marie Curie University) in Paris, working with Prof. M. Chetouani in the Institute for Intelligent Systems and Robotics (2012-2015). In 2015, he joined the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Service of Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital directed by Prof. D. Cohen focusing his works in robotics for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Since 2019 is coordinator of the French-Swiss project iReCheck, funded by the French National Agency for Research (ANR) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNS).  </p>
